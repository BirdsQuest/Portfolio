# Matt Birds Portfolio

Welcome to the portfolio of Matt Bird, here are examples over a few languages.
If you're a potential employer and would like to see something more specific, feel free to email me at <mattbird@randomcode.run>

## Browser Demos

A collection of demos designed to run in the browser, as I'm currently using an old ChromeBook; they have only been tested on Google Chrome.
They are using a combination of javascript and css, with no external libraries.
However, they are all using small portions of my own personal library(with the exception of the movieTheatre, which I wrote most recently as an exercise to write *without* my library).
If you would like to see more details, please see the [readme in Browser Demos directory](Browser%20Demos%20%5B%20js%2C%20css%2C%20%7Bphp%7D%20%5D/readme.md).
You can also check out the live demos at <https://randomcode.run/>

## LINE ChatBot

A couple of years ago, I made a PHP based layer over LINE Messaging API to make Chat Bots easier.
The official documentation doesn't cover PHP, so this may be a bit unique.
There is also a basic ticketing system to communicate with customers via the browser,
Included is a few demos; to learn more, please see the [readme in LINE ChatBot directory](LINE%20ChatBot%20%5B%20js%2C%20css%2C%20php%20%5D/readme.md).

## Java

Though I have many more projects in Java, I need to clean them up a little before showing them.
However I thought these two were somewhat novel.
If you would like to see more details, please see the [readme in Java directory](Java/readme.md).

## PHP mySQLWrapper

They say that a good coder is a lazy coder.
This is a wrapper for mySQL in PHP, with it database calls can be made with PHP without having to constantly having to swap between PHP and mySQL.
This makes database code both easier to write and easier to read.

## Android

Various java files of previous Android projects, made using gradle.
- Please note that these are not the full projects but only the core java files(with any relevent needed code in comments)

If you would like to see more details, please see the [readme in Android directory](Android/readme.md).

## localDB Chrome Extension

Once upon a time, I was working on a project and got pretty deep in.
However, I was hard coding all of the test data.
When it came time to attach it to a database, there was too overwhelming and I wound up scrapping the project to refactor on a rainy day.
I felt, when dealing with a database, it's important to write the code with it in mind.
So I made a Chrome Extension that saves data locally and acts as a basic database.
