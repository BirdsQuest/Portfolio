## deckViewWrapper

DeckView acts like a ListView. It utalises CardView, RecyclerView and SwypeRefreshLayout to achieve this.\n\nRecyclerView is a more optimised version of a ListView, the container for the cards.\nCardView shows the content inside the cards. Each individual entry in the list is a card\nSwypeRefreshLayout allows the list to fetch new data when dragged down from the top\n\nOn top of refreshing the list, removing/favoriting elements is bound to the left/right swipes and long pressing initiates drag and drop reordering
